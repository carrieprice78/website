## Assess Your Topic, Scope, and Goals
Assess your topic, scope, goals, and which resources you want to search. If your goal is a literature review, understand the type of literature review and the methodology involved. This step is a good time to do some preliminary background searching to get an idea of what's already been done. Hint: look for a question development framework that will help you frame your topic.

## Assess How You Plan to Search

In which databases would you expect to find relevant literature? This is the perfect time to ask a librarian or an information professional for guidance. Your project cannot be adequately supported with Google or Wikipedia. See your institution's site for database suggestions and a connection to the library.

### Formulating Your Research Topic

* Gather background information on your topic. Do a quick search to see what's been written about the topic so far.
* Consider your audience. Who will be interested in this issue?
* Identify a question framework to use to acheive clarity in the research question.
* Solicit input from collaborators, peers, and mentors.
* If you can, consult with a librarian or information professional to assist you with a thorough search.

### Which Databases to Search

In addition to connecting with a librarian for recommendations of the best available resources, you might find that Google and Wikipedia are helpful. Perform some searches to identify recommended databases for your topic. Your librarian will be able to determine access for these resources.
