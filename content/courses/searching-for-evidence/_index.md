Searching for evidence in a bibliographic literature database is a balance of trial and error, intuition, and practice. If you take the time to start off right, keep an open mind, and follow the appropriate steps, you're bound to find success. Use the ABCDE Research Inquiry Framework (Price, et al., 2020) to approach literature searching in an effective and reproducible manner.
