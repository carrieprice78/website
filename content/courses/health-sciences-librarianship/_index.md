I have been a clinical medical librarian and health sciences librarian since 2012. It's a profession of lifelong learning. In this guide, I'll list some resources that have helped me find my feet along the way, as well as some that look useful that I haven't had a chance to explore further. 

Take all the opportunities you can: to volunteer in clinical settings; to round with doctors; to attend department/division meetings. Read as much as you can about the disciplines you're interested in.
