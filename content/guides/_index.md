This collection of guides was primarily created by me for various users while I was a clinical medical librarian at the Welch Medical Library. Some of the content was not created by me and is attributable to the Welch Medical Library at Johns Hopkins University.

The guides are maintained frequently. You are welcome to [fork the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/carrieprice78/website) or suggest edits via the contact form on this site.
