## Why Establish a Researcher Profile?

Creating and maintaining a unique public profile for the dissemination and promotion of your research is key to establishing your identity as a researcher. A researcher profile serves as a persistent identifier linking together your scholarly output throughout your career. A research profile can:

* Link all variations and changes to your name to one profile 
* Disambiguate yourself from other researchers with the same or similar name
* Associate all of your publications throughout your career across multiple departments and institutional affiliations
* Enhance discoverability of your work by potential collaborators
* Make creating publication lists of your work fast and easy
* Allow you to take advantage of enhanced database features, such as tracking your h-index and and other research metrics

### ORCID

[ORCID](https://orcid.org/) is an acronym for "Open Researcher and Contributor ID." ORCID is an independent, non-profit, community-based registry of unique research identifiers that allows researchers to create and maintain their own researcher profile. Researchers can include their education, work history, citations, and other research output in a single profile. Profile content can be imported by linking your ORCID profile to a Scopus Author ID or the Web of Science Publons, or by manually adding data from PubMed or other sources.

### SciENcv

[SciENcv](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sciencv/), the Science Experts Network Curriculum Vitae, is a researcher profile system for all individuals who apply for, receive, or are associated with research investments from U.S.federal agencies. SciENcv is available in My NCBI.

### Google Scholar

[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is a search engine that searches the web for scholarly and peer reviewed literature. Google Scholar allows authors to create and maintain a profile page. Sign in to your Google Account and you'll be able to review your profile.

### Scopus

Scopus, a blbliographic literature database from Elsevier, automatically creates an Author ID for authors as new citations are added to the database. An algorithm attempts to link citations with similar attributes to an Author ID. You can find your Author ID and make any corrections to the citations associated with your profile.

### Publons from Clarivate Analytics

[Publons (formerly ResearcherID)](https://publons.com/about/home/) is the peer review activity tracker and researcher profile solution developed by Clarivate Analytics, the parent company of the Web of Science database. Upon registering, you are assigned a unique identifier you can use to manage your publication list, track citations to your work, and view your h-index, as well as a record of your work as a peer reviewer.
