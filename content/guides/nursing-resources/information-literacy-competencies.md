The American Library Association has released a set of standards for [information literacy competency standards in nursing](http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/nursing). These standards for nursing are based on the “ACRL Information Competency Standards for Higher Education” with outcomes written specifically to support nursing resources, language, and the value of evidence-based practice.
