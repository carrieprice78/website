## Creating Robust Searches
Searching is a combination of trial and error and practice. You can learn to strategize your approach to searching by experimenting. Effective searches contain concepts that define your topic. They may also contain both subject headings and additional keywords.

## Using Field Tags
Using field tags can help you make a more effective search. Field tags can be used to limit to title only, title abstract, author, first author, last author, MeSH term, affiliation, and more. Field tags are used within square brackets at the end of your search term. See more information on [field tags](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/help/#search-tags).
