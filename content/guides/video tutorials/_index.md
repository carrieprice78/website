## Making Video Tutorials

Creating high-quality instructional objects and video tutorials can be a challenge. I don't claim to be an expert, but have taken the time to learn some tools to create and maintain my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMqAATLPshn8Znip6E3QMSw).

### Step One

Have an idea of what you want to teach or convey, and write up a script.

### Step Two

If you want to use slides, make a corresponding slide deck for your script. Otherwise, run through your demonstrations to make sure they work.

### Step Three

Record the audio for your script using [Audacity, a free open source tool](https://www.audacityteam.org/).

### Step Four

Playback your script and use OBS Studio or video that can include screen capture or camera. [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) is also a free open source tool.

### Step Five

Put it all together in OpenShot Video Editor. [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/) is also a free open-source tool. Export your video and save! You're done! You can publish on YouTube or anywhere else.


### Need Help?

Lots of these tools have communities on YouTube and Reddit to help you with learning the basics and troubleshooting problems.
