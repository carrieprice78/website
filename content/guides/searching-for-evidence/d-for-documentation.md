## Why

If you document your search, it will save you time because you will remember what you did. Your search will be transparent and reproducible later.

## How To

Use a spreadsheet or document to keep track of all your searches. Document things like:
* Databases searched
* Limits applied, such as language or date range
* Keyword terms and controlled vocabulary terms used
* Number of results 

## Citation Management

You may also wish to keep track of your sources identified with a citation manager.
