## Generating Search Terms (Keywords)

Keywords are the words used in an article title, abstract, or other text field in a database. Keyword searching, or natural language searching, is how most people search for information and is often sufficient. One drawback of searching with keywords is that the words that you use must match the terms used by an author. 

To remedy this problem, a complete keyword search strategy will include multiple spellings and synonyms that represent the concept. Keyword searching is also useful when attempting to identify literature that may not have been indexed with controlled vocabulary terms, for any variety of reasons.

Think of synonyms, acronyms, antonyms, and initialisms associated with the concepts in your topic. See how other authors refer to your topic. Start by keeping a list in a document.

### Tips

* If looking for prevention, you will also need to look for causation.
* Review [MeSH](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/) or other database controlled vocabularies to find related terms
* Look at a relevant article on your topic to find potential keywords
* Browse a dictionary, thesaurus, or encyclopedia
