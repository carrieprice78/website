I have built a lot of LibGuides over the years. Here, I'll talk about what worked for me.

## Best Practices Guide (Internal)

Use your best practices guide internally. It should provide guidance to other LibGuide developers on best practices for

* **editorial practices** - how should users refer to the institution, email, ebook, or other terms that have variations?
* **color kit** - what colors are allowed on the guides?
* **allowed fonts** - what fonts can be used on the guide?
* **account privileges for different levels of users** - who has admin privileges? who is editor? who is regular?
* **responsive design** - is your media responsive? are your tables responsive?
* **accessibility** - how will you make the guide as accessible as possible? 
* **guide maintenance and retirement** - who is responsible for keeping the content current? what should one do when the guide is no longer needed?
* **use of images** - in what circumstances can someone use an image, and how should it be made accessible?

Many of these elements will be informed by your institutional branding guidelines, but you may need to make some special clarifications on other allowed colors or fonts, how you'll edit copy, how to make media accessible, and how to address accessibility in the platform.


### Help Area

Make sure that LibGuide builders know who to contact for help, and where they can find additional training.

* [LibGuides Community Sites](https://community.libguides.com/)
* [Springshare Help Center](http://support.springshare.com/libguides)
* [Springshare Training](http://support.springshare.com/libguides/training)

### Site Documentation

Upload your current documents to a site documentation page on the best practices guide, and keep it updated.

* customized CSS
* header code
* footer code
* subjects and tags metadata

## Storage and Reusable Elements Guide (Internal)

I used the storage guide to keep reusable boxes that appeared frequently on many guides. I also used a storage guide to display resuable elements like headers, boxes, and other customized CSS or HTML elements. A user could see what it looked like before using the code in their own site. Users could also simply reuse a box that had the correct information, and the boxes could be updated from one place.

You might also consider adding a sandbox page here, so that users can try out different designs before going live.

## Reusable Pages Guide (Internal)

As the content grew, I realized that it was better to have a reusable pages guide as well. Reusable pages are for things that require more than just a few boxes, like a process, a course, a lesson plan, or a database tipsheet. Users could map to the page, and the pages could be updated from one place.
