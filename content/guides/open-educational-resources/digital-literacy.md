These standards directly address the information skills needed by nursing students at the associate, baccalaureate, masterâ€™s and doctoral levels and are written for nursing faculty and librarians who support nursing programs and nursing students in academic settings. However, because many nursing students are also practicing nurses, the skills described in the standards can be used for continuing education in the nursing profession.
