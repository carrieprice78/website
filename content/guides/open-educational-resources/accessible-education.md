* Is a proactive and inclusive way of teaching and designing courses and curricula
* Removes barriers to learning before the barriers can have an effect
* Reduces the need for specialized accommodations
* Identifies and clearly expresses essential course content
* Is consistent with universally-recognized principles of good teaching

## Guidance for Accessible Education
### Accessible Documents

Accessible documents have:
* readable text that is not an image,
* tags to indicate a heading structure,
* alternate text for images,
* a set reading order,
* a set language,
* and use lists, tables, and hyperlinks wisely.

### What is Alternative Text?

Alternative text helps screen readers recognize and describe images used on websites. An image without alternative text cannot be described in context.

* Use alternative text when including an image in your guide.
* Alternative text is read by screen readers in place of images.
* Enter accurate text that avoids terminology such as "image of..." or "link to...".* 
* See [WebAIM's section on alternative text](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/).
