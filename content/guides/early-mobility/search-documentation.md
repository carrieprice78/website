Please note that these searches are incredibly specific and precise, and are not meant to be used to support any comprehensive or expert reviews. The goal of these searches is to find highly topical and relevant literature without a lot of noise.

These searches can be copied and pasted into the corresponding database. In Scopus and Web of Science, use "Advanced Search."
